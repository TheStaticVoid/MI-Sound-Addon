# Modern Industrialization Sound Addon

This is a mod that is intended to be used with the Modern Industrialization mod. It adds new sounds to all the existing machines, and offers modpack developers a way to extend these sounds to any custom singleblock or multiblock machines they have added using the KubeJS integration in Modern Industrialization itself.

Some of the `TickRecipeMixin` code was inspired by `TechReborn`'s implementation of machine sounds. ModMenu, Config, and KubeJS plugin implementation is based heavily off of Modern Industrialization's methods.
