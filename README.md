# Modern Industrialization Sound Addon

This is a mod that is intended to be used with the Modern Industrialization mod. It adds new sounds to all the existing machines, and offers modpack developers a way to extend these sounds to any custom singleblock or multiblock machines they have added using the KubeJS integration in Modern Industrialization itself.
If you have any questions, please join the [StaTech Industry Discord](https://discord.gg/RDaJEnN3uS) and ask there. 

## Credits
The sounds for this mod come from various open-source projects and resources. If you're the owner of one of the sounds and don't want me to use it in this mod, feel free to contact me and I will remove it. I will list them all below:

Some of the `TickRecipeMixin` code was inspired by `TechReborn`'s implementation of machine sounds. ModMenu and Config implementation is based heavily off of Modern Industrialization's methods.
